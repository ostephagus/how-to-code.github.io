	<div id="explanation">
  	  <h2>What are types?</h2>
	  <p>Types are the different ways of creating data. These are all shown in the table below:</p>
	<table id="table">
	  <tr>
	    <th>Name of type</th>
  	    <th>What it's for</th>
	    <th>Syntax</th>
	    <th class="rt">Example</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Integer</td>
		<td>Whole numbers only</td>
		<td>Just the number</td>
		<td class="rt">5</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Float</td>
		<td>Numbers with decimal points</td>
		<td>Just the number</td>
		<td class="rt">5.0</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Boolean</td>
		<td>The word True or False</td>
		<td>True or False with the capital letter</td>
		<td class="rt">True</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>String</td>
		<td>Every symbol on your keyboard</td>
		<td>In speech marks</td>
		<td class="rt">"Hello!"</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>List</td>
		<td>A list of all of the above types</td>
		<td>In square brackets and items are seperated by commas</td>
		<td class="rt">["Buy dog food", 1234, True, 12.34]</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td id="bt">Dictionary</td>
		<td id="bt">Phonebooks or anything where something means another thing</td>
		<td id="bt">In curly brackets, joined by colons and seperated by commas</td>
		<td class="rt bt">{"Emma": 0124539128, "Matt": 07434285121}</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
	</div>
	<div id="Dictionaries-explanation">
	  <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
	  <p>Dictionaries are by far the hardest type to get to grips with. They're confusing, seemingly useless and in fact aren't often used in computing. One really vital use for them is when you want to log in to a webpage. The username can be matched up with the password.</p>
	  <p>The first part of a dictionary is called the key. It is used to reference whatever is at the other side of the colon to it. If you want to, you can skip straight to the <a href="#lists-and-dictionaries">Lists &amp; dictionaries section</a></p>
	</div>
	<div id="Floats-and-ints">
	  <h2>Floats and integers</h2>
	  <p>Floats and integers (shortened to <span class="code">int</span>s in python) are actually very similar, the only difference is that floats have a floating point (you may also know this as decimal point) and integers don't.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="bools">
	  <p>Booleans are the type that python&reg; uses the most. This will make more sense in the <a href="/Users/Lenovo user/Documents/Coding/html/How to code/Python-page/Python-conditions-page.html">Python&reg; conditions and condition statements page</a> but basically, if you ask Python&reg; a question, it will reply with <span class="code">True</span> or <span class="code">False</span> instead of the everyday yes or no.</p>
