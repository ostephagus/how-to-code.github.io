		<h1>How To Code is under maintenance</h1>
		<h2>What's happening?</h2>
		<p>We're adding lots of content to our courses (especially the Python course and then the CSS course) so don't be worried if links don't work or you find a half-done page because it goes live as soon as we save things.</p>
		<h2>Why is it happening?</h2>
		<p>Because the courses aren't done yet and the website isn't at a stage that we're happy with yet.</p>
		<h2>When will it be done?</h2>
		<p>The truth is we don't know. There is lots to learn about each language so don't e expexting it to be done any time soon!</p>
