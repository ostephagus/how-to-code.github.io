		<h1>Reading error messages</h1>
		<p>Error messages are meant to be as easy as possible to understand. But there comes a problem: they were created by really good developers who thought that their error messages were easy to understand but really their not unless you know what to look for or you're a brilliant programmer that uses computers every free second of their lives. Which isn't most normal humans.</p>
		<h2>Where you've gone wrong</h2>
		<p>Most of the time, errors come about because of a typo so knowing where you've gone wrong is <strong>REALLY</strong> useful.</p>
		<p>In every error message, there will be the words <code>traceback (most recent call last):</code> and then the file you're creating (or <code>&lt;pyshell#0&gt;</code> if you're working in the shell)</p>
