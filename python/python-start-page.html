		<p>Python is one of the most used and most versatile programming languages in the world. You can create art with it, design websites with it and much more.</p>
		<h2>Firstly, what is Python?</h2>
		<p>There are 2 type of python. Python 2 and Python 3. The differences are that Python 2 is older, slightly harder to use but has more software for it and Python 3 is newer, slightly easier to use but there is less software for it. These tutorials use Python 2.</p>
		<h2>Get started with python</h2>
		<p>To download Python 2, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">click here</a> or on the picture below and download the latest python 2 (the yellow box that says "Download Python 2" with some numbers on the end).</p>

		<p>You should see a little pop-up called something along the lines of "Python Setup Wizard". Do what it tells you to do until you get a screen like the picture below.</p>

		<h2>Your first code</h2>
		<p>At the prompt(the <span class="prompt"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></span> on the 3rd line), type <code>print "Hello!"</code>
		<p>Under the line you just typed, it should say <code>Hello!</code>
		<p>Wow! You just typed your first code! But what does it all mean?</p>
		<p>Let's break it down. The <code>print</code> tells Python to put whatever is in the speech marks (the <code>"</code> and <code>"</code>) on the next line. You can put anything you want in between the speech marks except the backslash (\) and more speech marks.</p>
		<p>The next part of the tutorial is variables. <a href="python-variables-page.html">Click here</a>.</p>
