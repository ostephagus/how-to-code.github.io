   	<h1 class="page-title">Your first code in Python</h1>
	  <p>Python is one of the most used and most versatile programming languages in the world. You can create art with it, design websites with it and much more.</p>
	  <h2>Firstly, what is Python?</h2>
	  <p>There are 2 type of python. Python 2 and Python 3. The differences are that Python 2 is older, slightly harder to use but has more software for it and Python 3 is newer, slightly easier to use but there is less software for it. These tutorials use Python 2.</p>
	  <h2>Get started with python</h2>
	  <p>To download Python 2, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">click here</a> or on the picture below and download the latest python 2 (the yellow box that says "Download Python 2" with some numbers on the end).</p>

	  <p>You should see a little pop-up called something along the lines of "Python Setup Wizard". Do what it tells you to do until you get a screen like the picture below.</p>

	  <h2>Your first code</h2>
	  <p>At the prompt(the <span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> on the 3rd line), type <span class="code">print "Hello!"</span>
	  <p>Under the line you just typed, it should say <span class="code">Hello!</span>
	  <p>Wow! You just typed your first code! But what does it all mean?</p>
	  <p>Let's break it down. The <span class="code">print</span> tells Python to put whatever is in the speech marks (the <span class="code">"</span> and <span class="code">"</span>) on the next line. You can put anything you want in between the speech marks except the backslash (\) and more speech marks.</p>
    <p>The next part of the tutorial is variables. <a href="python-variables-page.html">Click here</a>.</p>
